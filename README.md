Make the Simulated Facebook App robust by handling potential errors such as invalid input, file I/O issues, and unexpected exceptions.

Problem Statement:
Save all posts to file(social media posts.txt) when the program exits.
handle exceptions like FileNotFoundException IOException and InputMismatchException.
Ensure the program continues running even if an error occurs.


hints:
use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.
Write the posts to a file use FileWrite.


Expected outcome:
create a robust simulation facebook app that handles errors gracefully and saves posts to a file.
